**Customer Churn Prediction for Subscription Services**

This project implements machine learning models to predict customer churn for subscription-based services or businesses. It leverages historical customer data, encompassing usage behavior and demographics, to identify patterns that indicate customer churn likelihood.

**Objective:**

- Develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting customer churn in a subscription service context.
- Use historical customer data to train and validate the models.
- Provide insights into factors that contribute to customer churn.

**Datasets:**

- It is the dataset of a U.S. bank customer for getting the information that , this particular customer will leave bank or not.

**Models:**

- **Logistic Regression:** A linear classification model suitable for binary classification tasks like churn prediction.
- **Random Forests:** An ensemble learning method that combines decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness to overfitting.
- **Gradient Boosting:** Another ensemble learning technique that iteratively builds decision trees on residuals from previous trees, enhancing model performance.
- **Support Vector Classification (SVC):** A kernel-based method that finds a hyperplane in high-dimensional space to optimally separate the classes (churned vs. retained customers).

**Implementation:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the customer churn dataset.
   - remove unwanted columns
   - Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
   - Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).
   - Feature scaling or normalization may be necessary depending on the chosen models.
2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train individual machine learning models using appropriate libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV) to optimize model performance.
3. **Model Selection and Interpretation:**
   - Based on evaluation metrics, select the best performing model for churn prediction.
   - Analyze the trained model to understand the features that have the greatest impact on churn prediction 
4. **Reporting and Visualization:**
   - Create reports summarizing model performance metrics, hyperparameter settings, and feature importance.
   - Visualize model performance using techniques like confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.



**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x (or compatible version)
